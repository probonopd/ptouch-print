.B ptouch-utility
is a command line tool that can be used to print labels with several
Brother P-touch label printers.

.SH OPTIONS
General options, font selection options and optput options are valid for the
whole printout and should be given only once.
Each duplication will override the previous argument value.

once in any order, and will be executed in the given order.

to use the mechanical cutter.

.SS "Font selection options"

limited to the printer's printable area.

Print the given text at the current position. Text including spaces must be
enclosed in quotation marks.
